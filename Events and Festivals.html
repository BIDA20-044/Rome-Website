<p>
Rome is an exciting place to visit at any time of year but it is always worth checking before your<br> 
trip to see what’s on. Since it is such an important centre for religion and particularly for Roman <br>
Catholicism, many festivals are religious in nature.
<br>
<br>
<b>La Befana Ephiphany</b>
<br>
The Feast of the Epiphany or La Befana Ephiphany takes place on January 6th to mark the end of<br>
 the Christmas celebrations. Traditionally, on this day, Italian children are given small gifts and sweets.<br>

<p>Rome’s Christmas festivities begin with the Christmas markets, which open at the beginning of December, 
selling handicrafts, decorations and delicious treats. The most famous of them is at Piazza Navona. Rome is
 well known for its nativity scenes, which are displayed throughout the city. Traditionally, they are 
 completed on Christmas Eve with the addition of the baby Jesus and this is when the life-size nativity scene 
 is unveiled in St. Peter’s Square. On December 8th the Pope marks the feast of the Immaculate Conception by 
 undertaking a pilgrimage from the Vatican to Piazza di Spagna, where he lays a wreath in front of the Church
  of the Trinita dei Monti at the Column of the Immaculate Conception.
